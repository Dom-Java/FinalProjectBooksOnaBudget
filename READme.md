Project Goal:
The goal of my project was to make an app that would provide users with the ability to find cheap history books from various wwebsites on the web. I wanted to do this project because I love history books and they are often over 
priced in todays society. 20 dollars for a new book that has the same content as a used one is just ridiculous. I was able to meet my goals by first creating a webscraper that search Abe books, Ebay, and ThriftBooks, for some
of their cheapest history books. I took the content of the webscraper and wrote them to several txt files. I took these files and wrote them into several Array. Finally, I took these arrays and wrote them into the Text Areas
in my GUI. I also made methods to filter searchs within these Arrays. Overall, the project was fun, and I am happy that I got to experiment with it.
